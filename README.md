# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews
Exploring the intricacies of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision
## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project conducted during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at InternCareer. The project aims to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques.
## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- models/: Saved models and weights.
- scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- reports/: Contains the final project report and visualizations.
## Key Features
- Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  - Collected IMDb movie reviews dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
  - Performed tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
- Model Development:
  - Built and trained a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow.
- Evaluation and Results:
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualized results with confusion matrices and heatmaps.
